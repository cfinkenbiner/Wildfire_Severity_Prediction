#### Wildfires account for a significant portion of total property losses and consequently highly impact the buisness insurance industry.
Total wildfire suppression costs have averaged approximately $2.6 billion over the past 5 years according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Verisk Analytics, a data analytics company that assesses insurance risk, identified more than 4.5 million U.S. homes as being at high or extreme risk of wildfire and on average more than 2,500 homes in the U.S. are destroyed every year due to wildfires. As a result, insurers face huge losses and many have pulled back from fire prone areas. This negatively impacts the insurance companies, as well as the local communities.

With high severity and low frequency, fire losses are inherently volatile, which makes modeling and predicting their impacts extremely difficult. Wildfires will only get worse due to warmer, drier environmental conditions, increases in drought severity, and longer fire seasons resulting from future climate change.

#### This project built Machine Learning Algorithms to predict wildfire severity using NASA spatial products and a large historical wildfire database.
My objective was to quantify and predict wildfire severity in the western U.S. based on relevant historical and spatial datasets. The spatial trends and drivers of wildfire severity can be used as a metric for homeowners and insurance agencies when negotiating insurance policies.

I downloaded NASA spatial datasets of soil and vegetation and collected historical records of fire location, total burned acres, and other noted damage resulting from a fire from an online database. The data was used with machine learning models to rate areas as having a low to high risk of wildfire severity. Additional features can be added to these models to improve future wildfire severity predictions and aid insurers with policy assessement.
